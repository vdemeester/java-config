This repository contains configuration and tools around [Java][] and its
ecosystem (which means [maven][], [scala][], etcâ€¦). This aims to be used with
[vcsh-home][] and [sh-config][] at least.

This repository currently contains :

* Some configuration for [mvnw][]
* Few other scripts for [maven][] that should be, someday, moved to [mvnw][].
* Few scripts to be able to run [maven][] and mr smoothly.
